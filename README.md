⚛️ NuclearX - Interactive Nuclear Reactor Simulator ⚛️

Version: 1.0
Author: Eng. Ezz Eldeen


🚀 Overview

NuclearX is a console-based interactive simulator for monitoring and simulating nuclear reactor operations. It combines:

💡 Real-time sensor monitoring

🎯 Scenario simulations

🛡️ Cyber attack simulations


All presented in a dynamic, visually engaging console interface.

> ⚠️ For educational and demonstration purposes only.




✨ Features

🖥 Interactive Console
Start, stop, check status, simulate scenarios, and trigger cyber attacks in real-time.

📊 Live Reactor Panel
Real-time monitoring of:

🌡 Temperature

⚡ Pressure

☢ Radiation

🌐 Neutron Flux
Indicators are dynamic and color-coded based on severity.


🔥 Threat Engine
Calculates a Threat Score based on reactor conditions & cooling system status.

🎛 Scenario Simulation
Run multiple scenarios:

meltdown 💥

coolantfailure 🧊

radiation ☢️

cyberattack 🖥️

sensorhack 🔧

overpressure ⚠️

blackout 💡

sabotage 🛠️

explosion 💣


🛡️ Cyber Attack Simulation
Visual alerts for cyber threats to reactor control.

📝 Incident Logging
Critical events are automatically logged to incident_report.txt.

⚙️ Requirements

.NET 6.0+ or compatible runtime

Console terminal: Windows / macOS / Linux



🛠 Installation

1. Clone the repository or copy the source code.


2. Open the project in Visual Studio, VS Code, or your preferred C# IDE.


3. Build and run the program.



💻 Usage

Use the console commands:

Command	Description

start	🟢 Start reactor monitoring
stop	🔴 Stop reactor monitoring
status	📈 Show current reactor readings
simulate	📄 List available simulation scenarios
simulate <scenario>	⚡ Run a specific scenario
attack	🚨 Trigger a cyber attack simulation
exit	❌ Exit the program


Example:

NuclearX> simulate meltdown
🔥 Meltdown scenario triggered!


🎯 Notes

The Live Panel updates dynamically, so values move like a real reactor dashboard.

Threat Score shows severity in real-time.

Combine scenarios and cyber attacks to test reactor stability.
